# Permission Set Object

[!INCLUDE [2021_releasewave1](../includes/2021_releasewave1.md)]

The permission set object in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] describes permissions on objects. Permission sets are building blocks used to compose assignable permission sets and [entitlements](devenv-entitlement-object.md). Assignable permission sets are permissions that an admin can assign to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], using the **Permission Sets** page. An entitlement is a collection of permission sets that constitute a set of meaningful permissions for a user.

Some permission sets can be non-assignable, meaning that they are not discoverable and assignable in the UI in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], instead they can be used as building blocks to compose functional assignable permission sets.

For information about which permissions can be assigned to objects, see [Permissions on Database Objects](devenv-permissions-on-database-objects.md).

## Designing with cautiousness

If a permission set is extended through AL, that extension will make additive changes to the permission set. This means that an extension can provide elevated privileges to an otherwise limited set of permissions. Building permission sets that can be extended must be done carefully with this in mind.

## Snippet support

Typing the shortcut `tpermissionset` will create the basic layout for a permission set object when using the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] in Visual Studio Code.

## Permission set example

The following example illustrates a permission set `Sales Person` with permissions given to data in tables, each with different level of access. The <!-- [Assignable property](properties/devenv-assignable-property.md)--> [Assignable property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-assignable-property?branch=new-properties) is set to `true` which allows the permission set to be assigned to a user. The <!--[Permissions property](properties/devenv-permissions-property.md)--> [Permissions property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-permissions-property?branch=new-properties) is set to the list of objects to give permissions to. The `RIMD` access assigned to data in the `Customer` table provides full access, whereas, for example, access is limited for data in the `Currency` table only allowing full read and modify permission. 


```al
permissionset 50134 "Sales Person"
{
    Assignable = true;
    Caption = 'Sales Person';

    Permissions = 
        tabledata Customer = RIMD,
        tabledata "Payment Terms" = RMD,
        tabledata Currency = RM,
        tabledata "Sales Header" = RIM,
        tabledata "Sales Line" = RIMD;
}

```

The following example of a permission set illustrates assigned permissions to run codeunits. With the <!-- [IncludedPermissionSets property](properties/devenv-includedpermissionsets-property.md) -->[IncludedPermissionSets property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-includedpermissionsets-property?branch=new-properties), we specify that the permission set `Sales Person` is also included in `MyPermissionSet`.

```al
permissionset 50130 MyPermissionSet 
{ 
    Assignable = true;
    Caption = 'My PermissionSet';
    IncludedPermissionSets = "Sales Person"; 

    Permissions = 
        codeunit SomeCode = x, 
        tabledata Vendor = RIm,
        codeunit AccSchedManagement= X; 
} 
```
