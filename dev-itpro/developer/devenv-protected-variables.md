# Protected Variables

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2.md](../includes/2019_releasewave2.md)]

Use the `protected` keyword on the declaration of a var section to make the declared variable within that section accessible from other objects within the same module. If you want to only expose some variables as `protected`, you must created two sections of var declarations. See in the syntax below.

## Syntax
```
protected var
        myInt: Integer;

var
        myLocalInt: Integer;
```
