# Resource Exposure Policy Setting

[!INCLUDE[2021_releasewave2_changed](../includes/2021_releasewave2_changed.md)]

When developing an extension, your code is by default protected against downloading or debugging. Read below about adding Intellectual Property (IP) protection against downloading or debugging into an extension to see the source code in the extensions.

The extension development package provides a pre-configured setting for protection against viewing or downloading the code of the extensions. However, this setting can also be controlled in the manifest; the `app.json` file.

## The properties of the resource exposure policy

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2, the `ShowMyCode` setting has been replaced by the `resourceExposurePolicy` setting which offers a richer access control. The `ShowMyCode` will be deprecated in a future release and cannot be used together with the `resourceExposurePolicy` setting. If `ShowMyCode` is set, default values for `resourceExposurePolicy` will be applied (`false`).

When you start a new project, an `app.json` file is generated automatically, which contains the information about the extension that you are building on. In the `app.json` file you can specify a setting called `resourceExposurePolicy` that defines the accessibility of the resources and source code during different operations. `resourceExposurePolicy` specifies the following list of options: `allowDebugging`, `allowDownloadingSource`, and `includeSourceInSymbolFile`. Each of these properties define the specific areas in which the source code of an extension can be accessed. All of the options are by default set to `false` which means that by default no dependent extension can debug or download the source code of your extension. The syntax of the `resourceExposurePolicy` setting is the following:

```al
`"resourceExposurePolicy": {"allowDebugging": <boolean>, "allowDownloadingSource": <boolean>, "includeSourceInSymbolFile": <boolean>}`
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The `resourceExposurePolicy` setting is not visible in the `app.json` file when it is generated. If you want to change the default value from `false`, you must add the setting as shown in the syntax example above.

### allowDebugging

To allow debugging into your extension, when the extension is taken as a dependency, you must set the `allowDebugging` flag, otherwise debugging is now allowed. The default value of `allowDebugging` is `false`. The **AL: Go!** template sets `allowDebugging` to `true`.

For a more refined setting, you can specify the `NonDebuggable` attribute on methods and variables. Regardless of the resource exposure policy setting, methods and variables marked with the `[NonDebuggable]` attribute, will remain non-debuggable. For more information, see [NonDebuggable Attribute](attributes/devenv-nondebuggable-attribute.md).

If you want to allow debugging into your extension to view the source code, the `allowDebugging` property in the `app.json` file must be set to `true`. For example, if a developer develops extension A and he or someone else on the team develops extension B, and B depends on A, then debugging B will only step into the code for A if a method from A is called and if the `allowDebugging` flag is set to `true` in the `app.json` file for extension A as shown in the example below. By adding this setting, you *enable debugging* into an extension to view the source code and variables when that extension is set as a dependency.

```json
`"resourceExposurePolicy": {"allowDebugging": true}`
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Even though `allowDebugging` is set to `false`, you will still be able to view that code if an extension is deployed through Visual Studio Code as a **DEV extension**, as opposed to deployed using a cmdlet, by using the **Extension Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] or via AppSource.

> [!NOTE]  
> `allowDebugging` does not apply to [Profiles](devenv-profile-object.md), [Page Customizations](devenv-page-customization-object.md) and [Views](devenv-views.md), because these objects cannot define any custom logic in procedures or triggers. The code for Profiles, Page Customizations, and Views defined in an extension with `allowDebugging` set to `false` can still be accessed and copied using [Designer](devenv-inclient-designer.md).

### allowDownloadingSource

When this is set to `true` in the `app.json` file of extension A, the source code and any media files of extension A can be downloaded, for example, from the **Download Source** option in the **Extension Management** page in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Extension A can be a PTE or a DEV extension. The default value of `allowDownloadingSource` is `false`.

### includeSourceInSymbolFile

When this is set to `true` in the `app.json` file of extension A, the downloaded symbol file in Visual Studio Code which is accessed by using the **Downloading Symbols** functionality, contains symbols, source code, and all other resources of extension A. **Go to Definition** to view the code also depends on this property. The default value of `includesourceInSymbolFile` is `false`.

### Example JSON file

Example JSON file with default values when generated by using the **AL: Go!** command.

```json
...
"resourceExposurePolicy": {
    "allowDebugging": true, 
    "allowDownloadingSource": false, 
    "includeSourceInSymbolFile": false
  },
  "runtime": "8.0",
  "keyVaultUrls": [
    "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net"
  ],
  "applicationInsightsConnectionString": "MyConnectionString1234"
...
```


## Overriding the resource policy

As a prerequisite for enabling overriding the resource policy, you must have a key vault set up. Follow the guidelines for keeping your key vault safe in the guidelines in these links. If the key vault is used for multiple purposes you can create different policies for access to override the secret in the key vault. For more information, see [Using Key Vault Secrets in Business Central Extensions](devenv-app-key-vault-overview.md) and [Setting up App Key Vaults for Business Central Online](../administration/setup-app-key-vault.md).
 
Once the key vault is set up, the policy of an extension can be overridden by using settings in your extension's key vault. A secret named `BC-ResourceExposurePolicy-Overrides` must be added to the key vault, the value of the secret is a .json file with the structure as shown in the example below. Because the json secret value in this case spans multiple lines, you must use Azure PowerShell instead of the Azure Portal to define these. To enable one or more of the properties for use by an AAD tenant, you must add the tenant ID to enable that property for the users of the tenant. This enables, temporarily, access to source code, for example, for debugging purposes. 

```powershell

$json = '{ 
    "allowDebugging": [ 
      "9e2b6561-1ba6-4790-abcc-c84abf9a8961" 
    ], 
    "allowDownloadingSource": [ 
      "9e2b6561-1ba6-4790-abcc-c84abf9a8961" 
    ], 
    "includeSourceInSymbolFile": [ 
      "9e2b6561-1ba6-4790-abcc-c84abf9a8961" 
    ] 
}'
$Secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $json -AsPlainText -Force
Set-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName "YourKeyVaultName" -Name "BC-ResourceExposurePolicy-Overrides" -SecretValue $Secret
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If debugging is enabled dynamically a breakpoint can be set in the protected source code when the debugging session is started.

### Partner telemetry

Specifying the `applicationInsightsConnectionString` setting for your extension, in the `app.json` file, enables a signal to be sent every time the policy is read from the key vault, if there is an issue with reading the policy, or an issue with parsing the JSON. For more information, see [Sending Extension Telemetry to Azure Application Insights](devenv-application-insights-for-extensions.md).

```json
"applicationInsightsConnectionString": "MyConnectionString1234"
```
