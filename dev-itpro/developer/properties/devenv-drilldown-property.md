## Property Value

**True** if a drill-down for the field is provided; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **false**.  

## Syntax

DrillDown = true;
```
  
## Remarks  

Drill-downs are a system-wide feature of [FlowFields](../devenv-flowfields.md) that let you see the underlying transactions that make up the information shown in the FlowField. For example, if the FlowField shows an account balance, then providing a drill-down for this text box lets the user quickly see the various transactions that make up the balance shown in the field.
