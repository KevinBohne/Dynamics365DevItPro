- Instead of exposing UI pages as web service endpoints, use the API pages or API queries because they've been optimized for this scenario. Select theâ€¯highest API version available. Don't use the beta version of the API pages. To read more about API pages, see [API Page Type](../developer/devenv-api-pagetype.md).

- If you do expose UI pages as web service endpoints, then triggers must be run for all records returned from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server. As a developer, you must make your AL code conditional on the `ClientType`. Specifically, avoid updating FactBoxes, avoid calculation, and avoid defaulting logic. For more information, see [System.GuiAllowed() Method](../developer/methods-auto/system/system-guiallowed-method.md).

- The choice of protocol (SOAP, OData, or APIs) for the endpoint can have a significant impact on performance. Favor OData version 4 or APIs for the best performance. It's possible to expose procedures in a codeunit as an OData end point using unbound actions. To read more about OData unbound actions, see [Creating and Interacting with an OData V4 Unbound Action](../developer/devenv-creating-and-interacting-with-odatav4-unbound-action.md).

- If you want OData endpoints that work as data readers (like for consumption in Power BI), consider using API queries and set `DataAccessIntent = ReadOnly`. For more information, see [API Query Type](../developer/devenv-api-querytype.md) and [DataAccessIntent Property](../developer/properties/devenv-dataaccessintent-property.md).
