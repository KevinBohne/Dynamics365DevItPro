## Partner Supported Countries/Regions and Translations

In countries, where Microsoft has not delivered a localization, partners can build [localizations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-develop-localization) using translation and localization apps that are published on AppSource. You can apply for access to build a localization on top of the international (W1) version of Dynamics 365 Business Central. The following table provides the list of countries/regions and translations supported through partners.

|Country/Region|Language Code|
