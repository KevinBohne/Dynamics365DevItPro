The fix will also be included in cumulative updates for supported versions of Business Central on premises. Learn how on premises customers can fix or work around the issue [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2201014).

**General availability of the Shopify Connector**  
Last October, we announced a new partnership with Shopify to help our customers create a better shopping experience. The partnership was designed to better connect the easy-to-use commerce and merchant experience of Shopify with the comprehensive business management capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The Shopify connector is now available for the online version of Business Central at no extra cost. Existing customers that have been upgraded to 20.1 or later versions, automatically get the Shopify extension installed. If they do not need the app, it can be uninstalled by following [this guidance](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions-install-uninstall#uninstall-an-extension).
