## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
|W1 | New field 'Intrastat Partner Type' on Customer and Vendor cards | The Intrastat Partner Type field has replaced the Parter Type field in Intrastat reporting. Partner Type is used in SEPA to define the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (Core or B2B). Intrastat Partner Type is used for Intrastat reporting only. This way, users can specify different values for the two fields if they need to. More details about setup [here](/dynamics365/business-central/finance-how-setup-report-intrastat). |
| W1 | Improvement in creating Intrastat file for item with supplementary UOM and without weight | When the line in Intrastat has supplementary unit of measure, weight for the item is not necessary. Now users can create the file even if they don't have weight for the item on Intrastat line if this item uses supplementary unit of measure. |

## Good to know

**General availability of the Shopify Connector**  
Last October, we announced a new partnership with Shopify to help our customers create a better shopping experience. The partnership was designed to better connect the easy-to-use commerce and merchant experience of Shopify with the comprehensive business management capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The Shopify connector is now available for the online version of Business Central at no extra cost. Existing customers that have been upgraded to 20.1 automatically get the Shopify extension installed. If they do not need the app, it can be uninstalled by following [this guidance](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions-install-uninstall#uninstall-an-extension). Read the [blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2022/05/26/dynamics-365-business-central-now-includes-a-shopify-connector/), the [FAQ](/dynamics365/business-central/shopify/shopify-faq), watch the [on-demand session](https://aka.ms/BCShopifySession), learn how to [get started](/dynamics365/business-central/shopify/get-started) and view the listing on [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/dynamics-365-business-central?surface_detail=global-erp-partners&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=collection).

**A single tile to go to Business Central**  
We're simplifying access to Business Central online by transitioning to a single app tile starting in June 2022. Learn more [here](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/single-tile-go-business-central).

**Action required by July 2022 for Excel Add-in**  
Starting in July 2022, Microsoft will roll out an update to the Excel add-in that further secures the connection to Business Central. The update requires that you modify your organization's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) configuration so that users can continue using the add-in. This impacts all Business Central on premises deployments that use the Excel add-in. Learn more [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/update-excel-addin-configuration).

**Changes to the Per-Tenant Extensions Disclaimer**  
The disclaimer for per-tenant extensions has changed. Find the new Business Central PTE disclaimer [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193002&clcid=0x409).
