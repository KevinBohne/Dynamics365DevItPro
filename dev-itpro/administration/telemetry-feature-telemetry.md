# Feature telemetry

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The Telemetry AL module simplifies the way you monitor the health of your app and the uptake and usage of application features. There are multiple benefits of using the module compared to sending telemetry via `Session.LogMessage`. For example:

* Different features can be compared across the same metrics.
* Common information is sent together with every feature telemetry message, which allows for advanced filtering capabilities.

## Register the feature telemetry module in an app
If you want to get feature telemetry to the app/extension telemetry pipeline, you must add a codeunit that implements the "Telemetry Logger" interface. Below is a simple example on such a codeunit.

```AL
/// <summary>
/// Adds support for the extension to use the "Telemetry" and "Feature Telemetry" codeunits.
/// </summary>
codeunit 50101 "Sample Telemetry Logger" implements "Telemetry Logger"
{
    Access = Internal;

    procedure LogMessage(EventId: Text; Message: Text; Verbosity: Verbosity; DataClassification: DataClassification; TelemetryScope: TelemetryScope; CustomDimensions: Dictionary of [Text, Text])
    begin
        Session.LogMessage(EventId, Message, Verbosity, DataClassification, TelemetryScope, CustomDimensions);
    end;

    // For the functionality to behave as expected, there must be exactly one implementation of the "Telemetry Logger" interface registered per app publisher
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Codeunit, Codeunit::"Telemetry Loggers", 'OnRegisterTelemetryLogger', '', true, true)]
    local procedure OnRegisterTelemetryLogger(var Sender: Codeunit "Telemetry Loggers")
    var
        SampleTelemetryLogger: Codeunit "Sample Telemetry Logger";
    begin
        Sender.Register(SampleTelemetryLogger);
    end;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you fail to setup a "Telemetry Logger" codeunit, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server logs an event to your telemetry. For more information, see [Error telemetry for the app publisher](#loggererrors) below.

## Using the FeatureTelemetry codeunit (log usage, errors, or uptake)

It's easy to use the Feature Telemetry codeunit. For example, to register the usage of a feature, you can just use the `FeatureTelemetry.LogUsage(<tag>, <feature name>, <event name>);` method. After the telemetry is emitted, you can aggregate and display the data. For example, you can use the **Feature Usage** Power BI report. The report is available on our [BCTech](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/blob/master/samples/AppInsights/AL/FeatureTelemetry/Feature%20Usage.pbix) GitHub repository.

:::image type="content" source="../media/FeatureUsageReport.png" alt-text="The FeatureUsage Power BI report":::

There are three kinds of events that you can log through the Feature Telemetry codeunit.

`FeatureTelemetry.<LogUsage|LogError|LogUptake>(...)`

* `LogUsage` should be called when the feature is successfully used by a user.
* `LogError` should be called when an error must be explicitly sent to telemetry. 
* `LogUptake` should be called when a user changes the uptake state of a feature. There are four uptake states for features:
  * `Undiscovered` 
  * `Discovered` 
  * `Set up` 
  * `Used` 

## Log uptake

If a feature logs uptake, there should be calls to register the `Discovered`, `Set up`, and `Used` states. The following list describes the current convention for registering uptake states:

* `Discovered` should be registered when pages related to the given feature are opened (or when a user looks for information about a feature).
* `Set up` should be registered when the user performed a set up for the feature (usually right after a record in a table related to the feature is added or updated).
* `Used` should be registered when a user attempts to use the feature (note the difference with LogUsage, which should be called only if the feature is used successfully).

> [!NOTE]
> Tracking the uptake status of a feature might make database transactions. If `LogUptake` is called from within a try function, the `PerformWriteTransactionsInASeparateSession` parameter should be set to `True`.

Calling `LogUptake` when the uptake state is `Undiscovered` resets the uptake state of the feature. The telemetry from this call will be used to calculate the values in the uptake funnel of the feature.

If `LogUptake` is called from a try function, the `PerformWriteTransactionsInASeparateSession` parameter should be set to `true`.

## <a name="LogError"></a> Log errors

You call `LogError` when an error must be explicitly sent to telemetry. For example, after a call to a try function, when `Codeunit.Run` returned false, when sending an http response error message, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> In case an error happens in a database transactions that will be rolled back, the `LogError` will still log an event to telemetry. 

See sample KQL code below to get started analyzing error telemetry.


## Feature and event names

Feature names should be short and easy to identify. For example, *Retention policies*, *Configuration packages*, and *Emailing*. Event names should specify the scenario being executed. If `LogUsage` is called, the event name should use the past tense because the event has already happened. For example, `Email sent` or `Retention policy applied`. If `LogError` is called, the event name should use the present tense. For example, `Sending email`, `Loading template`).
