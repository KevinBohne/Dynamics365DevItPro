# Analyzing Report Generation Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave1.md](../includes/2020_releasewave1.md)]

Report generation telemetry gathers data about reports that are run on the service. It provides information about whether the report dataset generation succeeded, failed, or was canceled. For each report, it tells you how long it ran, how many SQL statements it executed, and how many rows it consumed.

You use this data to gather statistics to help identify slow-running reports.

## Success report generation

Occurs when a report dataset generates without any errors.

### General dimensions

The following table explains the general dimensions of this trace.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|operation_Name|**Success report generation**<br /><br />**Note:** The use of the `operation_Name` column was deprecated in version 16.1. In future versions, data won't be stored in this column. So in version 16.1 and later, use the custom dimension column `eventID` column custom in Kusto queries instead of `operation_Name`.|
|message|Version 16.1 and later:<br />**Report rendered: {report ID} - {report name}**<br /><br />Before version 16.1:<br />**The report {report ID} '{report name}' rendered successfully**|
|severityLevel|**1**|

### Custom dimensions

### Analyzing report generation failures

When a report fails to generate, the `result` column in the CustomDimensions will include the title of the exception that was thrown by the service or the AL code.  

## Cancellation report generation

This operation occurs when the report dataset generation was canceled. There are various conditions that can cancel a report. The **Cancellation report generation** operation emits different trace messages for each condition.

### <a name="reportcancellation"></a>Analyzing report cancellations

The cancellation messages indicate events that caused the report to be canceled. The telemetry can help identify slow-running reports - reports that take longer than expected to run and generate a large number of rows.

> [!NOTE]
> The service evaluates cancellation events in a specific order, and the evaluation is done every five seconds. For more information, see [Report Generation and Cancellation Flow](report-cancellation.md).

#### Cancellation event received. Requesting cancellation of the action.

This message occurs when the session canceled a report as it was being generated.

#### Received a cancellation request from the user. Requesting cancellation of the action.

This message occurs when a user canceled a report in the client as it was being generated.

#### The action took longer to complete ({0}) than the specified threshold ({1}). Requesting cancellation of the action.

The service is configured to cancel reports if they take longer to generate than a set amount of time. With Business Central online, you can't change the threshold. With Business Central on-premises, you change the threshold by setting the **Max Execution Timeout** parameter on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. There's no timeout for on-premises by default. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#Reports).

#### The rendering of the word report has been cancelled because it took longer than the specified threshold ({0})"

This message occurs when a report that based on a Word layout takes longer to generate than the specified threshold. The event is only relevant for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online. There's no timeout for on-premises.

#### The number of processed rows exceeded ({0} rows) the maximum number of rows ({1} rows). Requesting cancellation of the action.

The service is configured to cancel reports if they generate more than a set number of rows. With Business Central online, you can't change this threshold. With Business Central on-premises, you change the threshold by setting the **Max Rows** parameter on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. There's no limit on rows for on-premises by default. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#Reports).

## <a name="commit"></a>Report cancelled but a commit occurred

This operation occurs when the report dataset generation was canceled but a COMMIT operation occurred before the cancellation. This pattern isn't recommended. Reconsider the report design.

### General dimensions

The following table explains the general dimensions of the **Report cancelled but a commit occurred** operation.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|The report \<ID\> \'\<Name\>' is being canceled, but a COMMIT() has been performed. This can lead to data inconsistency if the report is not idempotent|
|severityLevel|**2**|
