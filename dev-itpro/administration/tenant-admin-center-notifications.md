# Manage Tenant-Specific Notifications

There are several ways to get notified of administrative events that occur on environments in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online tenant, such as an upgrade succeeding or failing or when extensions require changes to be compatible with an upcoming update. We communicate through several channels, such as email notifications, Microsoft 365 Message Center, and Application Insights telemetry.

> [!NOTE]
> If a prospect has signed up for a trial of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], make sure that they understand that they must sign up for notifications. This is especially important if the prospect moves to My Company so that the tenant will expire after 30 days. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central Trials and Subscriptions](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview) in the business functionality content for Business Central.

## Communication Channels
Environment lifecycle events are communicated through various channels, each with their own benefits.

### Email Notifications
Notifications are sent to all email addresses that are listed in the **Notification recipients** list of the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]. The list is managed manually by adding and removing recipients to ensure the right individuals are notified.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important that *at least* one administrator's email address has been entered as a notification recipient to ensure proper awareness of events requiring administrative attention.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To not miss update notifications from Microsoft, you must verify that the emails are not redirected to a spam folder by your email software. The notifications are sent from `no-reply-dynamics365@microsoft.com`.

### Microsoft 365 Message Center
Most Environment Lifecycle events for which emails are sent will soon also be posted to Microsoft 365 Message Center. Over time, emails sent to notification recipients set up in [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] will be a subset of messages posted in Message Center, and eventually emails sent to notification recipients will be deprecated.  

Already now, we warmly recommend that you make sure that the relevant people [sign up to receive email notifications from the Message center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center#preferences). For more information, see the article [Message center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center) in the Microsoft 365 admin content.

If you're a delegated admin, you might not be able to sign up yourself. In those cases, ask the internal admin to add you or a group email account as recipients. Also, in some scenarios where your organization manages multiple tenants, you might want to use the service communications API in Microsoft Graph to access the health status and message center posts about [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Access service health and communications in Microsoft Graph](/graph/service-communications-concept-overview).

### Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard

### Application Insights
Application Insights telemetry includes the most complete list of Environment Lifecycle events, and can better be used for automation and reporting purposes than the other communication channels.

Learn more about Environment Lifecycle trace telemetry [here](telemetry-environment-lifecycle-trace.md).

#### Customizing Notifications and Automation
Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate have built-in connectors to query telemetry in Application Insights that you can use to set up custom notifications or to automate certain actions triggered by an Environment Lifecycle event.

> [!NOTE]
> Samples of custom notifications and automations are shared by Microsoft and third parties on the [Business Central BCTech repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/AppInsights/Alerts). You can also share your Application Insights Alerts and Automations with the community on GitHub.

The samples below can help getting started with customization and automation using Application Insights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploying a Logic App to Azure also creates the API Connection Resources necessary to authenticate certain actions in the Logic Apps.
>
> After deploying the Logic App, navigate to the created API Connection Resources in the Azure Portal to authenticate them. The Application Insights API Connection Resource can be authenticated using the Application ID and an API Key. These can be found and generated on the API Access page of the Application Insights Resource in the Azure Portal.
>
> If you have already have API Connection Resources deployed in the selected Resource Group for the connections needed to run the Logic App you can reuse them by entering the same resource name before deploying the Logic App.

##### Grouped Notification for Available Updates
This Logic App runs every number of days (specified in deployment) and lists all updates made available to environments that emit telemetry to the specified Application Insights resource for the specified period. Administrators can use this to replace the many email notifications they would receive for each individual enviroment when set up as notification recipient.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FBCTech%2Fmaster%2Fsamples%2FAppInsights%2FAlerts%2FAvailableUpdatesNotification.json)

##### Notification for Deleted Environment
This Logic App queries Application Insights every number of minutes (specified in deployment) and notifies a user (also specified in deployment) of any deleted environments in Microsoft Teams. The action that sends the notification in Teams can be updated to notify a Channel or Group Chat instead.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FBCTech%2Fmaster%2Fsamples%2FAppInsights%2FAlerts%2FDeletedEnvironmentNotification.json)

##### Action each Failed Environment Update
This Logic App runs a query that returns any failed environment updates ever number of hours (specified in deployment). Customize the Logic App after deploying to action the failed update, for example by opening a case in Dynamics 365 Customer Service using the Dataverse connector.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FBCTech%2Fmaster%2Fsamples%2FAppInsights%2FAlerts%2FActionFailedEnvironmentUpdate.json)

#### Reporting
To make it simple to analyze Business Central telemetry, there is a Power BI app available from Microsoft AppSource. This app includes an Administration report which shows an inventory of environments including various environment operations details built with the Environment Lifecycle telemetry in Application Insights. Learn more [here](telemetry-power-bi-app.md) or get it immediately from [Microsoft AppSource](https://aka.ms/bctelemetryreport).

> [!NOTE]
> The Power BI reports and dataset that make up this app are available on the [Business Central BCTech repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/AppInsights/PowerBI/Reports/AppSource/enrironment-app-pbix). You can customize those resources for your own needs and publish from Power BI desktop.

### Tenant Admin Center Operations Page
The operations page does not notify you of environment lifecycle events, but does provide some details on these operations that are not available in other channels, like the email address of the user that executed an operation. Learn more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#opslog).

## Notification of blocked updates

Microsoft updates environments according to the update windows that are defined for the environment in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]. However, if the environment includes an app that isn't compatible with the next version, Microsoft pauses the update and sends a notification of the issue.  

After a while, all users see an in-product notification, which may confuse some people. But Microsoft wants to update the environment, so an admin must disable and remove the problematic app so that the update can continue. After more than a month of waiting, Microsoft sends a more strongly worded notification. If the environment is still blocked from getting the update after more than 4-5 months, Microsoft uninstalls the problematic app, but doesn't delete any data. The environment is updated with the latest security and other updates.  

The following list illustrates a typical timeline:

* 10 weeks of emails sent to the registered notification recipients.  

    If the update fails, Microsoft reschedules automatically. The notification recipients will receive multiple emails. If no notification recipient has been set up, then no email is sent.
* Six weeks with in-product notifications that encourage users to contact their admin.  

    This notification currently indicates that the environment will expire to worry users so they try to find their admin to sort out things.
* One month of more explicit in-product notifications

    This notification currently indicates that the environment is missing an important update and is blocked. The wording has been chosen to make it clearer what the issue is and what the user must do as quickly as possible.  

If the problematic app hasn't been uninstalled at this point, Microsoft typically starts the process of force-uninstalling apps, including per-tenant extensions. Data isn't deleted.  

For more information about updates, see [Major Updates and Minor Updates for Business Central Online](update-rollout-timeline.md). For more information about how to keep your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] compliant with upcoming updates, see [Maintain AppSource Apps and Per-Tenant Extensions in Business Central Online](../developer/app-maintain.md).  

## Cleaning up settings

If you end the relationship with a customer where you have set up your email address as a notification recipient, you must remove the email address while you still have access to that customer's [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)].
