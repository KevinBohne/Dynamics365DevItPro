# Setting up the Business Central Add-in for Excel in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] On-premises

This article provides guidance for how to configure [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premise so that users can edit data in Excel by using the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] add-in for Excel.

> [!NOTE]
> This article does not apply to the older Excel add-in that was available for installation with the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)] client by using the [!INCLUDE[prodsetup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)] in versions older than 2019 release wave 2.

## Overview
  
You can set up the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] deployment to support an add-in that enables users in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] client to work with data from list pages in Excel. Users can get fresh data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] into Excel and push updated data from Excel to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

Without this add-in, users can open a list page in Excel from the **Open in Excel** action on the page. But the **Open in Excel** action doesn't allow them to push changed data back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. When this add-in is set up, the **Edit in Excel** action is added. The add-in is based on the [Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629) available from the Office Store.

For more information about how users work wth Excel from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], see [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-work-with-excel).

> [!NOTE]
> The Excel add-in is not available in the mobile apps.


<!--
## Deploy the Excel add-in for Business Central online

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the administrator can deploy the add-in for all users. But users can also install the add-in themselves, provided they have permission to configure their Office experience.  

> [!TIP]
> In some organizations, administrators cannot deploy add-ins centrally. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To deploy the Excel add-in for all users

1. As the administrator, sign in to the Microsoft commercial website and find the add-in at [https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629).
2. Choose the **Get it now** button.

    You'll be redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
3. In the left panel, go to **Settings**, and then choose **Add-ins**.
4. In the **Configure add-in** pane, specify which users to grant access to the add-in.
5. Save your changes.

When users now choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in will launch as a pane in Excel. Each user will be automatically logged in and connected to their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], but if a user cannot connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow the steps in the [To configure the connection](#to-configure-the-connection) section.

### To add the Excel add-in locally

1. Open Excel, and then open any Excel workbook.
2. On the **Insert** menu, choose **Office Add-ins**, and then choose **Admin managed** or **Store** as appropriate.
3. Search for *Dynamics Office Add-In*, and then install the add-in.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, you must configure the connection.

### To configure the connection

1. In the Dynamics 365 Excel add-in, choose **Add server information**, and then in the **Server URL** field, enter `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`.
2. Choose the OK button, and then confirm that the app reloads.
3. When prompted, sign in with your Azure Active Directory account.
4. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!TIP]
> If the workbook is not automatically saved to the user's OneDrive, then recommend them to save all workbooks that they export from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. When they open the workbook again, the connection is still available, so they do not have to configure the connection again.

> [!NOTE]
> In certain deployments, the administrator must configure network access to unblock the Excel add-in. For more information, see [Preparing Your Network for the Excel Add-In](configuring-network-for-addins.md).

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. In this section, we provide tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Issue  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|The add-in doesn't start|Check if the add-in is deployed centrally, or if the user is blocked from installing it locally. | The admin can configure Office so that users cannot acquire add-ins. In those cases, the admin must deploy the add-in centrally. For more information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).|
|Data does not load into Excel|Test the connection by opening another list in Excel from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. Alternatively, open the workbook in Excel in a browser.|If the user has specified a company name that contains special characters, the add-in might not be able to connect. |
|Data can't publish back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. |Test the connection by opening the workbook in Excel in a browser. |Sometimes an extension can block the publishing job. If the page is extended or customized, remove the extensions, and then try again.|
|The dates are wrong  |Excel might show times and dates in a different format than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. This doesn't make them wrong, and the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] will not get messed up.|         |
|For some list pages, editing multiple lines in Excel consistently causes errors. This condition can occur if OData calls include FlowFields and fields outside of the repeater control.|On the **Web Services** page, select the **Exclude Non-Editable FlowFields** and **Exclude Fields Outside of the Repeater** check boxes for the published page. Selecting these check boxes excludes non-editable FlowFields and field from the eTag calculation. |These check boxes are hidden by default. To show them on the **Web Services** page, use [personalization](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user). |
-->
## Prepare Business Central

Your on-premises deployment must meet the following prerequisites:

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) used to authenticate users.

   The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, clients, and users must be configured for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication, including OData. For more information, see [Authenticating Users with Azure Active Directory](Authenticating-Users-with-Azure-Active-Directory.md).
 
- OData enabled and uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for authentication.

   For more information, see [Using Security Certificates with Business Central On-Premises](../deployment/implement-security-certificates-production-environment.md).  

- [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] configured to use SSL (https).

  For more information, see [Configure SSL to Secure the Connection to Web Client](../deployment/Configure-SSL-web-client-connection.md).

- If your deployment is multitenant, [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] must accept host names for tenants.

  For more information, see [Configure the Web Server to Accept Host Names for Tenants](configure-web-server-to-accept-host-names-for-tenants.md).  

- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] client computers have a supported version of Excel.

   For more information, see [System Requirements](../deployment/System-Requirement-business-central.md#WebClient).

## Expose the Business Central application Web API in Azure AD

When [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] is configured for Azure AD authentication, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application is registered as an application in an Azure AD. Before the Excel add-in can be configured, you must configure the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application in Azure AD to expose its Web API.

For information about how to expose the Web API, see [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose web APIs](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis).

## Register and configure an application in Microsoft Azure

When Azure AD authentication was set up for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] deployment, an Azure AD tenant was created in Microsoft Azure, and an application for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] was registered in the tenant. The Excel add-in requires that you add (register) a separate Azure AD application in the Azure AD tenant.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), register an application in the Azure AD for the Excel add-in.

   For guidelines, see [Register your application with your Azure Active Directory tenant](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-app-registration).

   When you add an application to an Azure AD tenant, you must specify the following information:

    |Setting|Description|
    |-------|-----------|
    |Name|The name of your application as it will display to your users, such as *Excel Add-in for Business Central*.|
    |Supported account types|Specifies which accounts that you would like your application to support. For purposes of this article, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. |
    |Redirect URI|Specifies the type of application that you're registering and the redirect URI (or reply URL) for your application. Select the type to **Web**, and in the redirect URL box, enter URL for signing in to the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)], for example `https://localhost:443/BC190/SignIn`.<br /><br />The URI has the format `https://<domain or computer name>/<webserver-instance>/SignIn`, such as `https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/BC190/SignIn` or `https://MyBcWebServer/BC190/SignIn`. **Important** The portion of the reply URL after the domain name (in this case `BC190/SignIn`) is case-sensitive, so make sure that the web server instance name matches the case of the web server instance name as it is defined on IIS for your [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] installation.|

    When completed, the **Overview** displays in the portal for the new Excel Add-in application. Make a note of the name or copy the **Application (Client) ID** for the next step.

2. Grant the Excel add-in application permission to access the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application Web API.

    Give the Azure AD application for the Excel add-in delegated permission to access the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application Web API in Azure AD (which you exposed earlier in this article). This permission allows users of the Excel add-in to access the OData web services to read and write data.  

    1. From the application's **Overview**, select **API Permissions**.
    2. Select the **Add a permission**
    3. On the **APIs my organization uses**, select the Business Central application.
    4. Select **Delegated permission**.
    5. Search for Business Central API by using registered application's name or application ID.
    6. Select the permission from the list, then select **Add Permission**. 

    For information, see [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis).  
3. Configure OAuth2 authentication in the Excel add-in.

    The Excel add-in requires OAuth2 implicit grant flow to be enabled on the Excel add-in application. You configure OAuth2 in the manifest file for the Excel add-in application. From the application's **Overview**, select **Manifest**, and then set `"oauth2AllowIdTokenImplicitFlow"` and `"oauth2AllowImplicitFlow"` to `true`:

    ```
    "oauth2AllowIdTokenImplicitFlow": true,
    "oauth2AllowImplicitFlow": true,
    ```

4. In the manifest, add the following URL entry to the `"replyUrlsWithType":`:

    ```  
    {
        "url": "https://az689774.vo.msecnd.net/dynamicsofficeapp/v1.3.0.0/*",
        "type": "Web"
    }
    ```  

    Remember to add a comma before or after this entry, depending on where you add it in the list.

5. Copy the **Application (Client) ID** that is assigned to Excel add-in application.

    You can get this value from the **Overview** page for the application. You'll need it to configure the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance.

This completes the work you have to do in the Azure portal. The final configuration is to add the Excel add-in to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances.

## Configure the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance

You add the Excel add-in to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances in your deployment. You can use either the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] or  [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserverconfiguration) in the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].

1. In the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)], in the **Azure Active Directory** section, set the **Excel add-in AAD client ID** field to the application (client) ID for the Excel add-in application that you copied from the Azure portal.

   If you're using the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet, set the `ExcelAddInAzureActiveDirectoryClientId` key.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure the  **Azure AD App ID URI** is set to the App ID URI of the registered app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] in the Azure AD tenant.

2. In the **Client Services** section, set the **Web Client Base URL** field to the base URL of the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)].

    This value is the root portion of all URLs that are used to access pages in the web client. The value must have the format `https://[hostname:port]/[instance]`, such as `https://MyBCWebServer/BC` or `https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/BC190`.

    If you're using the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet, set the `PublicWebBaseUrl` key.

3. In the **OData Services** section, configure or verify the following settings:

   1. Set the **OData Base URL** field to the public URL for accessing OData services.

       The URL must have the following format `https://<hostname>:<port>/<instance>/ODataV4/`, such as `https://localhost:7048/BC190/ODataV4/`.

       With the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet, set the `PublicODataBaseUrl`key.
   2. Select the **Enable API Services** check box.

       If you're using the Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet, set the `ApiServicesEnabled` key to `true`.

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel Add-In

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the Add-In is installed and a number of service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, see [Preparing your network for the Excel Add-In](configuring-network-for-addins.md).  

## Next steps

The next step is to get the add-in installed in Excel of the users. As an administrator, you can set up Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically install the add-ins to users in your organization. Or, you can allow users to install it themselves from the Office Store. For more information, see [Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-deploy-excel-addin) in the business functionality help.

<!--
Centralized Deployment is a feature available in the Microsoft 365 admin center for automatically installing add-ins in Office apps of users, like Excel. Centralized Deployment provides you a way to get the Business Central add-in in for Excel to users when your organization doesn't allow users to access the Office Store (AppSource). 

1. Verify that Centralized Deployment works for your organization.

   For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
2. In Business Central, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../developer/media/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
3. Choose **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** > **Next**.
4. On the **Configure Microsoft 365**, read the informan choose **Next**.
5. On the **Configure Business Central** page, turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch, then choose **Finish**.
6. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967).

7. Go to the **Settings** > **Integrated apps** > **Add-ins** page.
8. Follow the steps at [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-in) to search for and deploy the **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** from the Office Store

After you finish, you can always change the deployment in admin center, like assigning more users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An add-in can take up to 24 hours before the add-in is available to users.



## Use the Excel Add-In

Your users can now use the Excel add-in. When a list page shows the **Edit in Excel** action, then users can open lists, such as the **Customers** page, in Excel and work with the data there. They use the add-in to update data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and get fresh data from the database. For more information, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-work-with-excel).  -->

<!-- > [!NOTE]  
>  The pages that your users want to work on in Excel must be published as web services. -->
