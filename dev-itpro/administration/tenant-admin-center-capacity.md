#  Managing Capacity

To help customers manage and plan their storage costs on an ongoing basis, the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] includes the **Capacity** page. The **Capacity** page provides an overview of the total database and file storage usage, with details about the storage used by every environment. The page also displays the currently used and the maximum allowed number of production and sandbox environments available for the customer.  

Customers can purchase additional database capacity and environments via their reselling partner by using the following add-ons:  
- Dynamics 365 Business Central Database Capacity 
- Dynamics 365 Business Central Additional Environment Add-on

## Number of environments

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] administrators can create multiple sandbox and production type environments for various purposes, like:
- Creating more business branches
- Moving into more countries
- Expanding within their current country
- Development
- Testing changes
- Learning new product capabilities

Every [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] customer with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Premium or Essential subscriptions can use one production environment and three sandbox environments, at no extra charge.  

Customers can also choose to purchase any number of additional production environments via their CSP partner. Each production environment comes with three additional sandbox environments.  

Production and sandbox environments can be created and used in any country where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] service is available, also in the country where the default [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] environments are located. Additional environments can be created by customers, administrators, and partners by using the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]. 

When customer administrators create users in Microsoft 365 Admin Center and assign them [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] licenses, each user, by default, gets access to all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] environments (sandbox and production) under the same single [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] license, still acting within the scope of their license within each of these environments. Administrators can limit users' access to any particular environment by [changing their permissions](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-define-granular-permissions), or by [removing users' access](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions#to-remove-a-users-access-to-the-system) within that environment. 

### Customers with Premium or Essentials subscriptions purchased before October 1st 2020

Existing customers with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Premium or Essentials subscriptions purchased before October 1st 2020 will keep their existing environment entitlements (three production and three sandbox environments) for a period of 1 year until October 1st 2021 or until their subscription is renewed or ended, whichever occurs last. 

Access to two additional production environments during this period won't increase your overall database storage capacity and won't enable extra sandbox environments. These benefits are only activated with the production environments purchased by the customers separately.

Examples (for subscriptions purchased before October 1st 2020): 
 - your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] subscription renews **before** October 1st 2021 - you can use up to three production environments until October 1st 2021. After that date, you will only be entitled to one production and three sandbox environments.
 - your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] subscription renews **after** October 1st 2021 - you can use up to three production environments until the day your subscription renews. After that date, you will only be entitled to one production and three sandbox environments.

When your entitlement for two additional production environments expires, the additional production environments you may have created during that period will still be fully available, you will not be automatically charged for the extra environments, but in order to become compliant you will have to purchase additional production environments via your CSP partner within 30 days following the expiration date. See the **Exceeding capacity quotas** section for more details. 

Use the **Capacity** page to see how many environments of each type you have available for your organization.  

## Storage

Storage capacity usage of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] is represented by **Database** and **File** on the **Capacity** page.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] customers can use up to 80 GB of database storage capacity across all of their environments (production and sandbox), meaning that the sum of database capacity usage of all of their environments must not exceed 80 GB.  

Some businesses have unique scenarios that may require additional storage. For those organizations that need more space, there is an option to purchase extra database capacity as an add-on to their existing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] subscriptions through their reselling CSP partner. Every add-on increases overall database capacity quota by 1 GB.  

Every additional production environment purchased by the customer also increases tenant-wide database capacity quota by 4 GB.  

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Capacity** page to help manage the migration when you migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online. That way, you know if your migration will bring you close to or over the current limits on database size, for example.

#### Storage usage by environment

The **Storage usage by environment** section of the **Capacity** page provides a tenant-level view of where your organization is using storage capacity. Here you can see how much database and file storage is used by each environment. For each of your environments, you can also navigate to the [Table Information page](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-view-table-information) within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], which let's you see the distribution of data size across tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the environments running on version 17 (2020 release wave 2) and later are included in the database capacity calculations.  

The **File usage** storage is calculated based on the size of the content of the following tables: 

- Tenant Media 
- Tenant Media Thumbnails 

The content of the other tables is counted towards the **Database usage** storage.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you uninstall extensions, you have a choice of deleting or leaving the extension data in the database. If you decide not to delete the data when uninstalling extensions, this data will be counted in the overall database storage you use.  

## Exceeding capacity quotas 

Exceeding the paid database storage limit won't interrupt transaction processing within the existing environments. The existing environments that organically grow and eventually exceed the quota will still be accessible and available for the customers to continue their business operations. You will not be automatically charged for the extra storage occupied by these environments. 

However, once the capacity limits are exceeded, the customers won't be able to create new environments or copy their existing environments until the storage used by the existing environments is decreased to fit the quota or additional capacity is purchased. These operations will also be blocked for the customers who have more environments than they are entitled to, accoring to their subscription and purchased environment add-ons.  

Administrative actions are currently not limited by the File storage, however similar restrictions will be applied to the File storage with one of the next releases of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

## Reducing Data Stored in Databases

There are a few things that you can do to reduce the amount of data stored in a database to keep it under its current limit. For more information, see [Reducing Data Stored in Databases](database-reduce-data.md).
