# Production and sandbox environments

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

You can create environments of different types. Which type of environment to choose depends on what you need it for.  

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to environments, get an overview of how Microsoft Entra ID, environments, and companies work in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online at [Understanding the infrastructure of Business Central online](tenant-environment-topology.md).

<!--The following table outlines some of the benefits of each environment type.

|Column1  |Column2  |

|Row1     |         |
|Row2     |         |
|Row3     |         |
|Row4     |         |
|Row5     |         |-->

## Production environments

[!INCLUDE [admin-env-prod](../developer/includes/admin-env-prod.md)]

[!INCLUDE [admin-env-quota](../developer/includes/admin-env-quota.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [admin-suspended](../includes/admin-suspended.md)]

### Manage production environments

Use the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to manage the environments manually. For more information, see [Managing Production and Sandbox Environments](tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

Instead, use the [Administration Center API](administration-center-api.md).  

## Sandbox environments

[!INCLUDE [admin-env-sandbox](../developer/includes/admin-env-sandbox.md)]

[!INCLUDE [admin-env-quota](../developer/includes/admin-env-quota.md)]

### <a name="partnersandbox"></a>Partner sandboxes

As a partner, you can buy the *Dynamics 365 Business Central Partner Sandbox* license. You'll need a valid Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID. You must also have at least five employees who will use the partner sandboxes that you create using this license. This offer was made available in February 2022 to support partners that need non-production environments to learn, test, and deliver end-to-end customer demos with their solutions. The *Partner Sandbox* license gives access to Business Central Premium functionality and acts as a normal *Premium* license that your customers might acquire.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The licenses that you acquire through the *Dynamics 365 Business Central Partner Sandbox* license are strictly meant for use only on the partnerâ€™s tenant. You are not allowed to use this license in a customer tenant, nor in a production environment.  

Use the *Partner Sandbox* license for a Microsoft 365 account that does not currently have a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] license. The *Partner Sandbox* license gives you 1 production environment + 3 sandboxes, provided that it's a Microsoft 365 account that never had a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] license. Alternatively, use the *Partner Sandbox* license to replace existing [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] licenses in an existing environment; however, the license will not give you any additional environments on top of the environments you already had.  

Partners can purchase the unique, partner-only license via Web Direct to create flexible, cost-effective solutions that do not expire. Accessing the SKUs and pricing is simple: [Go to experience.dynamics.com](https://experience.dynamics.com/requestlicense/) and submit a request for the *Dynamics 365 Business Central Partner Sandbox* license. Use a valid MPN ID. Once your request is approved, you receive a token to purchase the SKUs directly. Pay by credit card. If the total billing is over $500/month for your company, then you can pay by invoice.

### <a name="precautions"></a>Precautions for sandbox environments with production data

[!INCLUDE [admin-env-sandbox-precautions](../developer/includes/admin-env-sandbox-precautions.md)]

### Manage sandbox environments

Use the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to manage the environments manually. For more information, see [Managing Production and Sandbox Environments](tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

Alternatively, use the [Administration Center API](administration-center-api.md).  

### Pre-sales performance evaluation

[!INCLUDE [perf-demo](../developer/includes/perf-demo.md)]

### Advanced user experience

It is possible to enable and try the full functionality of the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] in a sandbox environment by setting the **Experience** field on the **Company Information** page to *Premium*. Find the **Company Information** page in the :::image type="icon" source="../media/search_small.png" border="false"::: menu in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. However, we recommend that you as the admin set up dedicated demonstration environments instead. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments](demo-environment.md).  

### Complete sample data

The standard demonstration company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] includes sample data for a limited number of scenarios. You can also create a new company with the **Advanced Evaluation - Complete Sample Data** option. In this type of company, users can take training or step through walkthroughs that require more sample data, such as [Walkthrough: Receiving and Putting Away in Basic Warehouse Configurations](/dynamics365/business-central/walkthrough-receiving-and-putting-away-in-basic-warehousing). This sample data is different from the standard sample data, and we advise that you do not capture and share screenshots with this advanced sample data.  

For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]](/dynamics365/business-central/about-new-company) in the business functionality content.
